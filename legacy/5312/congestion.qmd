```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('nyctraffic.csv')
df.columns
```

Data ranges from 2000-2025.

Each observation in this dataset represents the total
traffic volume recorded by a traffic camera in a
fifteen minute interval. There are 1,838,386 of these
intervals recorded by ~3710 seperate cameras. These
cameras are not necessarily consistent in time and space.

```{python}
pd.crosstab(df['Yr'],df['M'])
```

Traffic counts do not consistently populate the data until
2009. 2025 data is present through June; populated months beyond that
are errors.

```{python}
df = df[df['Yr'] >= 2009]
df.loc[(df['Yr'] == 2025) & (df['M'] >= 7), 'Vol'] = pd.NA
```

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry='WktGeom', crs='EPSG:2263')
```
