## Q: What data do we want to use?
- E.g., hourly (for now)
    - Sum by adding 4 quarters
- Pick one neighborhood w/ well-defined boundaries, good data to focus on
    - caution for spatial autocorrelation
    - apply to other neigborhoods
    - (or even one camera)
- find full year comparison to capture seasonality; risk confounding otherwise
